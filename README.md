# Kraphoot

It's like Kahootâ„¢ but not really.

Based on: https://jmcker.github.io/Peer-to-Peer-Cue-System it was trivial to implement a student-teacher broadcast type system which handles:

- "quiz questions" defined on the server side
- Students joining a teacher's session
- The teacher able to send the questions to the student's views, and let them choose an answer.
- Results view
